        <dd>Fire is a chemical reaction that produces heat, light, and various gases. 
            It typically involves the rapid oxidation of a material in the presence of oxygen, 
            releasing energy in the form of heat and light. Fire is essential for cooking, heating, 
            and providing light, but it can also be destructive if not controlled.

        <dt>Water</dt>
        <dd>Water is a transparent, tasteless, and odorless chemical substance composed of hydrogen and oxygen molecules (H2O). 
            It is vital for all known forms of life and plays a crucial role in various biological processes. 
            Water exists in three states: solid (ice), liquid, 
            and gas (water vapor), and it covers about 71% of the Earth's surface.
